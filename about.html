			<h3> Why migrating to DevOps ? </h3>
			
			<p>Since I decided to take my first Cloud certification, I fell in love with cloud and it's subjects</p>
			<p> DevOps is a culture that helps teams to work better together, and it's a way to improve the development process</p>
			<p> So this lead me to learn more about DevOps and its practices like CI/CD, and tools that makes this happens like Terraform, Git, Github actions, docker, kubernetes and so on</p>
            <p> I like to code, but i'm not a developer, so I'm learning to code in my spare time and using my experience in IT infrastructure to build and automate things, which allows me to code something I enjoy and find useful</p>
