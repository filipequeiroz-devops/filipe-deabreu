			<h3> Why migrating to cloud ? </h3>
			
			<p>Since I decided to take my first Cloud certification, I fell in love with cloud and it's subjects</p>
			<p>I figured how big this is and how this is helping small and big companies to reach their goals whiteout much effort </p>
			<p>On-premises infrastructure it's still being used, and it will. Cloud isn't replacing everything we already have, at least not now, but cloud is a solution that works along on-premises infrastructure and make it better </p>
